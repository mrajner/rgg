%%
%% just set all important values as in this example 
%% and run (pdf)latex command on this file 
%%
%% you do not need to change the original submitted file
%% which can be sourced (\input{...})
%% or just simply set this value in the submitted tex source file
%% like below:
%%    \documentclass[
%%    startpage = 10,
%%    ...,
%%    ]{rgg}

\PassOptionsToClass{
  % select the number of starting page, volume, year and doi
  % if logodg argument is present (or `logodg = true`) than deGruyter 
  % logo is printed at first page
  %
  % due to parsing of global options if string contains
  % spaces, it should be embraced with double curly braces
  % like in example below for type, received and accepted field
  %
  % if review is set (`review = true`) than the version for reviewers
  % is generated
  startpage = 11,
  volume    = 123,
  year      = 2015,
  doi       = 152.rgg/abcd,
  review    = false,
  type      = {{Reviev article}},
  received  = {{1 February 2018}},
  accepted  = {{6 June 2018}},
  logodg,
