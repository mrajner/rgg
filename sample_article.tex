1. Introduction 

To prepare the paper for “Reports on Geodesy and Geoinformatics” use editor MS Word for Windows. Use font Arial for the whole text. For the title and subtitles use type size 12 with Arial bold font. For the text use the font size of 12 points. Capitalize the first word and all other principal words of the titles and subtitles.

The paper should be prepared using A4 paper format with the following margins: upper, left and right and bottom margins to be set at 2.5 cm.

2. Figures, equations and tables 

The figures and subscriptions should be numbered below the figures and centred, e.g. >"Fig. 1. Text"< (align to the left of figure, use the font size of 11 points).
